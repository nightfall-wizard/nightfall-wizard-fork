## 1. Cryptographic suite

| Piece | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Curve | **Ristretto** (curve25519) throughout — one curve, one encoding |
| Hash | **Blake3**, domain-separated and length-prefixed |
| PoW | **Nighthash-v2** = `Argon2id(header_preimage ‖ nonce_le, salt, m, t, p)` — memory-hard |
| Commitments | **Pedersen** `C = v·G + b·H`, generators from `bulletproofs::PedersenGens` |
| Range proofs | **Bulletproofs**, 64-bit, one per output |
| Signatures | **Schnorr** on Ristretto, generator-parameterised |
| Payload encryption | **XChaCha20-Poly1305**, key from ECDH shared secret |
| Address | `nf1` ‖ hex(scan_pk ‖ spend_pk) ‖ hex(checksum[..4]) |

`H = hash_to_group(G)` is a NUMS point. The whole soundness argument rests on
nobody knowing `x` with `H = x·G`.

### 1.1 Key hierarchy

```
seed ─┬─> scan_sk  (a)   A = a·G   detect + decrypt
      └─> spend_sk (b)   B = b·G   authorise spending
```

- **Address** = `(A, B)`.
- **View key** = `(a, B)` — finds and opens every output, cannot sign.

### 1.2 Output (one-sided stealth, MWEB-style)

Sender draws ephemeral `r`, publishes `Ke = r·G`:

```
t   = H("shared" ‖ r·A)        receiver recomputes as H("shared" ‖ a·Ke)
b   = H("blind"  ‖ t)          blinding factor
o   = H("ko"     ‖ t)          one-time key offset
Ko  = B + o·G                  one-time output key
key = H("aead"   ‖ t)          payload encryption key
```

On-chain fields:

```
features:     Plain | Coinbase   public; drives maturity
commit:       Commitment        v·G + b·H
range_proof:  Bulletproof       proves v ∈ [0, 2^64)
ephemeral_pk: [u8;32]           Ke
output_pk:    [u8;32]           Ko
payload:      Vec<u8>           AEAD(value ‖ blind ‖ memo[64])
sender_sig:   SchnorrSig        by r, verifiable against Ke
```

The payload is constant length, so ciphertext size reveals nothing about the
memo. **No recipient identifier appears anywhere.**

Spending `Ko` requires `b_spend + o`. The sender knows `o` but not `b_spend`, so
the sender cannot reclaim what they sent.

A scanning wallet must verify `Commitment::new(value, blind) == commit` before
accepting an output — otherwise a malicious sender can claim a payment they did
not make.

### 1.3 Input

```
commit: Commitment    must already exist in the UTXO set
sig:    SchnorrSig    under the Ko recorded in the set, over input_message
```

The one-time key is read from the UTXO set, never from the transaction.

### 1.4 Kernel

```
feature:     Plain | Coinbase
fee_darks:   u64        burned in full; public by design so the burn is auditable
reward_darks:u64        coinbase only
lock_height: u64
excess:      Commitment excess·H
excess_sig:  SchnorrSig Schnorr over generator H
```

**Balance equation:**

```
Σ outputs − Σ inputs + fee·G − reward·G  =  Σ kernel_excess
```

Sign check: `Σ excess` must be signed under `H`. Knowing the discrete log of a
point w.r.t. `H` proves it has no `G` component, i.e. the amounts cancel exactly.
*Equality alone proves nothing* — that was the v4 bug. The signature carries the
soundness.

### 1.5 Signature binding

```
kernel_msg = H(feature, fee, reward, lock_height, excess)
input_msg  = H(commit)
output_msg = H(features, commit, Ke, Ko, range_proof, payload)
```

Every consensus-relevant field is signed by exactly one of the three. **None
binds a transaction body** — see §2.0; a block dissolves its transactions, so a
body-bound signature would stop verifying.

Replaying a captured input signature is useless: the output leaves the UTXO set
the moment it is spent. Re-routing value is prevented by the kernel, which
requires knowledge of the input's blinding factor that no third party has.

---

## 2. Blocks

```
header:
  version:      u32
  height:       u64
  prev_hash:    Hash256      hash of the previous header, nonce included
  utxo_root:    Hash256      Merkle root over the sorted UTXO set
  kernel_sum:   Commitment   running Σ of every kernel excess ever accepted
  body_root:    Hash256      hash over the aggregated body
  timestamp_unix: u64
  difficulty:   u64
  nonce:        u64
  reward_darks: u64
body:
  inputs:  [Input]    sorted by commitment
  outputs: [Output]   sorted by commitment
  kernels: [TxKernel] sorted by kernel id
```

### 2.0 Aggregation

**A block contains no transactions.** Every transaction selected for a block is
merged into one flat set of inputs, outputs and kernels, then sorted
canonically. An observer sees *n* inputs, *m* outputs and *k* kernels with no
indication of which input paid which output — CoinJoin at block level, applied
automatically and without coordination.

Canonical ordering is a consensus rule. A block whose sets are not sorted is
rejected, because the order a miner chose would otherwise leak the original
transaction grouping.

Aggregation is why no signature binds a transaction body:

| Signature | Covers | Verified against |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel excess | feature, fee, reward, lock_height, excess | generator `H` |
| Input | the commitment being spent | the `Ko` in the UTXO set |
| Output (sender) | features, commit, `Ke`, `Ko`, proof, payload | `Ke` |

**Cut-through is not applied.** See §7.

`pow_hash = Nighthash-v2(header_preimage, nonce)`; the pre-image excludes the
nonce. Block identity is `H(preimage ‖ nonce)`.

**PoW parameters are consensus data**, not a local setting:

| Network | Memory per hash | Iterations | Lanes | Verify cost |
|---------|-----------------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Mainnet | 32 MiB | 1 | 1 | ≈ 11 ms |
| Testnet | 8 MiB | 1 | 1 | ≈ 2.5 ms |
| Devnet | 1 MiB | 1 | 1 | ≈ 0.8 ms |

Memory-hard proofs are symmetric: verifying costs the same as one mining
attempt. A node therefore records a local validation marker so it does not
re-hash its own chain on every restart; any change to the stored blocks file
forces full re-verification.

### 2.1 Difficulty

A hash `H` (big-endian 256-bit) satisfies difficulty `D` when

```
H · D < 2^256
```

computed exactly with 64-bit limbs — no division, no big-integer dependency.
Work per block is `D`; cumulative chain work is an exact `u128` sum.

**Retarget:** LWMA-1 (Zawy) every block over a 90-block window, target 15 s.
Solve times clamped to `[−5T, +6T]`, per-block movement clamped to ±2×, with a
network-specific floor.

### 2.2 Timestamps

- Must be **strictly greater** than the median of the previous 11 blocks.
- Must not exceed local time by more than **120 s**.

### 2.3 Chain selection

**Highest cumulative work wins.** Never block count. Reorgs deeper than 500
blocks are refused.

### 2.4 Coinbase maturity

| Network | Blocks |
|---------|--------|
| Mainnet | 1,440 (~6 h) |
| Testnet | 60 |
| Devnet | 10 |

### 2.5 Checkpoints (`assumevalid`)

A release may pin one or more historical mainnet block hashes in
`CHECKPOINTS` (`nightfall-types`). Below a pin, proof of work is not
re-hashed on replay: linkage, UTXO roots and the pin itself still are.
A chain that never reaches the pinned height is fully checked.

This is a **trust assumption** — you trust the builder not to have
pinned a hash from a chain of their own — the same class of assumption
as Bitcoin's `assumevalid`. `NIGHTFALL_NO_ASSUME_VALID=1` turns it off.
Reproduce a pin with:

```
cargo run --release -p nightfall-node --example checkpoint -- <height>
```

Never add a pin from a single machine. Current pin: height **25,000**.

### 2.6 Pruned nodes

A node may drop block **bodies** older than [`MAX_REORG_DEPTH`] (500),
keeping:

- the UTXO set (and the supply invariant)
- compact headers from genesis (difficulty, MTP, hash-walks)
- the last 500 full bodies (the reorg window)

This is a **local storage policy**, not a consensus rule. A pruned node:

- still validates new blocks in full
- cannot serve `GetBlocks` below the prune height — IBD needs an archive
- cannot rescan stealth outputs from genesis; use an archive node or the
  light API (`scan_feed` on a seed)
- cannot export a full snapshot

`--prune` / Core → Settings → **Prune old blocks**. Seeds that serve IBD
or `--mobile-listen` stay archives. A pruned datadir that fails its
validation record cannot re-hash the dropped bodies; resync from a seed.

The same class of assumption as Bitcoin's prune: you trust this node's
own disk, not a stranger's UTXO snapshot.

### 2.7 On-disk chain format

A node reads whichever chain file it finds in its datadir:

| File | Encoding |
|---|---|
| `blocks.jsonl` | one JSON object per line (historic default) |
| `blocks.bin` | `u32` little-endian record length, then bincode |

`blocks.bin` wins if both are present. An **empty** datadir — a fresh
install — starts out binary; an existing `blocks.jsonl` keeps its format
until the operator converts it. Snapshots are written under the name of
the format they contain and carry a `format` field in `snapshot.json`;
the importer converts if the destination differs.

A datadir written in binary cannot be read by a node older than the
format: it finds no `blocks.jsonl` and resyncs from genesis. That is a
software downgrade cost, not a chain event.

**Neither is consensus.** A block hash is computed over raw field bytes,
never over the serialised form, and the P2P wire stays newline-delimited
JSON. A converted node and an unconverted node hold the identical chain
and talk to each other unchanged. This is a disk layout, nothing more.

The reason to convert is that `serde_json` renders a `[u8; 32]` as an
array of decimal numbers — `[241,118,175,…]` — so every byte of every
hash, commitment, signature and range proof costs about 3.6 characters.
Measured on mainnet at 31,288 blocks:

| | Size | Per block |
|---|---|---|
| `blocks.jsonl` | 152.3 MiB | 5.10 KiB |
| `blocks.bin` | 42.2 MiB | 1.41 KiB |

**72.3 % less disk**, same tip, same UTXO root, same supply proof.

Nothing converts by itself:

```
nightfalld --network mainnet migrate-storage
```

The command writes `blocks.bin.tmp`, reads it back, compares **every
block hash** against the source, and only then swaps the files. The old
file is kept as `blocks.jsonl.pre-binary`. Stop the daemon first — there
is no lock on the chain file.

---

## 3. Emission

Era-0 reward **6 NIGHT**, halving every **7,500,000 blocks**, hard cap
**90,000,000 NIGHT**, no tail.

Because each halving truncates (`reward >> halvings`), the curve terminates at
**89,999,999.25 NIGHT** — 0.75 below the ceiling. The cap is an upper bound.

---

## 4. Fees

While the subsidy is positive, `fee_darks` is burned. The miner receives only
the subsidy. After the subsidy is zero, the coinbase kernel carries the block's
fee total: nothing is minted, nothing is burned, circulating is unchanged, the
miner is paid. The fee remains a public `fee·G` term so the books still close.

---

## 5. Validation checklist

Per transaction (stateless):

- shape limits: ≤ 512 inputs, ≤ 512 outputs, ≤ 64 kernels, ≥ 1 output
- no duplicate inputs or output commitments
- all commitments and one-time keys are valid group elements
- every output carries a valid range proof bound to the network context
- every kernel signature verifies under `H` against `body_hash`
- `Σout − Σin + fee·G − reward·G == Σ kernel_excess`
- coinbase kernels carry no fee; plain kernels carry no reward
- a coinbase spends no inputs

Per block (stateful):

- protocol version matches
- height links, `prev_hash` links
- timestamp > median-time-past, ≤ now + 120 s
- difficulty equals the schedule; PoW meets it
- reward equals the emission schedule at this height and supply
- minting would not exceed the cap
- coinbase is transaction 0 and the only one
- every input exists in the UTXO set, is mature, and is correctly signed
- `tx_root`, `utxo_root` and `kernel_sum` match after application
- **the supply invariant still holds**

State is applied atomically: a rejected block leaves the node byte-identical.

---

## 6. Networking

Newline-delimited JSON over TCP.

- Messages capped at **4 MB**, enforced before allocation.
- ≤ 128 blocks per request; ≤ 64 peers.
- Handshake checks network id, wire version and genesis hash.
- Sync fetches forward from the local tip; it does not replay from genesis.
- Mempool: fee-ordered, conflict-checked, capped at 10,000 entries.

---

## 7. Known gaps

Deliberately listed in the spec so they are not forgotten.

- **Cut-through is not applied, and cannot be under this design.** Plain
  Mimblewimble can delete an output created and spent inside the same block,
  because ownership there is proven only by knowing a blinding factor that the
  kernel already covers. Nightfall additionally signs each input with the
  one-time key of the output being spent — the signature that makes
  *non-interactive* payments safe, without which the sender could sweep back
  what they sent. Deleting the input would delete that authorisation.
  One-sided payments and cut-through are mutually exclusive; `DECISIONS.md`
  chose one-sided payments.

  The consequence, stated plainly: **spent outputs stay visible, so the graph
  is obscured by aggregation but not erased.** Closing the remaining gap needs
  a proof system that can authorise a spend without publishing a per-input
  signature.
- **Dandelion++ transaction relay.** Negotiated peers carry an explicit stem
  phase over the backward-compatible `Tx` message. Routing is epoch-stable,
  stem transactions remain in a separate non-mineable stempool, failed stem
  writes receive at most one route repair, and a randomized 12–28 s embargo is
  the availability fallback before public diffusion. Legacy peers remain
  fluff-compatible. See `docs/PRIVACY.md` and `docs/DANDELION-PP-V2.md`.

- **UTXO root is O(n log n) per block.** A Merkle Mountain Range would make it
  incremental.
- **Startup replays the whole chain.** No headers-first sync, no snapshots, no
  pruning.
- **No multi-asset support.** `asset_id` was removed rather than left as a field
  the value commitment ignored — the v4 arrangement would have permitted
  cross-asset inflation the moment a second asset existed.
