//! A validation record has to mean "I checked this", not "a file says so".
//!
//! The chain file carries no signature, and it does not need one: a node
//! re-derives every block hash and re-checks every proof of work on load.
//! That full check is skipped only when the datadir's own record says this
//! exact file was already verified here — otherwise starting a node would
//! mean re-verifying the whole chain every time.
//!
//! The record used to be nothing but a tip hash and a byte count. Both
//! travel with the file. So shipping `blocks.bin` next to its
//! `chain-meta.json` handed the recipient a chain that was never checked,
//! and the failure was silent: the node started, reported the height, and
//! looked entirely healthy.
//!
//! That matters most for the thing this test was written alongside — a
//! downloadable chain archive, so newcomers do not sync from genesis. An
//! archive is only safe if unpacking it cannot switch the checking off.
