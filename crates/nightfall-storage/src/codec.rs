//! How a block is written to disk, and how it is read back.
//!
//! The chain file was JSON, one block per line, and that cost more than it
//! looked. `serde_json` renders a `[u8; 32]` as an array of decimal numbers —
//! `[241,118,175,…]` — so every byte of every hash, commitment, signature and
//! range proof becomes about 3.6 characters. Measured on the live mainnet
//! file: 31,288 blocks, 152.3 MiB, **5.10 KiB per block** with a single output
//! and a single kernel in it. Extrapolated over a year of 15-second blocks
//! that is 10.7 GB of an *empty* chain, before anybody sends anything.
//!
//! The same chain in the compact binary encoding is 42.2 MiB: 1.41 KiB per
//! block, **72.3 % less disk**, converted in about a second. Identical tip,
//! identical UTXO root, supply proof unchanged.
//!
//! Two things this deliberately is not:
//!
//! * **Not a consensus change.** Block hashes are computed over raw field
//!   bytes, never over the serialised form, so how a node stores its file
//!   cannot change what the network agrees on. A binary node and a JSON node
//!   hold the identical chain.
//! * **Not a wire change.** This is the on-disk file only. P2P messages stay
//!   newline-delimited JSON, so a node that converts its storage still speaks
//!   to every other node exactly as before.
//!
//! Nothing converts by itself. `nightfalld migrate-storage` does it on
//! request, verifies the result before swapping, and keeps the old file. A
//! node reads whichever format it finds.
