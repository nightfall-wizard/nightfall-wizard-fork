//! Block-level aggregation.
//!
//! A block does not store transactions. It stores one flat, canonically sorted
//! set of inputs, one of outputs and one of kernels. Every transaction that
//! went into it dissolves.
//!
//! # What this achieves
//!
//! An observer sees *n* inputs, *m* outputs and *k* kernels with **no
//! indication of which input paid which output**. The anonymity set for a
//! payment becomes every transaction in the block, rather than the payment
//! standing alone as its own visible object. This is CoinJoin at the block
//! level, applied to every block automatically and without coordination.
//!
//! Sorting is what does the work. Inputs and outputs are ordered by
//! commitment, kernels by identifier — all of which are effectively random
//! values, so position carries no information about origin. Leaving the
//! original order intact would have made grouping trivially recoverable.
//!
//! # What this does not achieve
//!
//! **Cut-through is not applied**, and cannot be under this design. In plain
//! Mimblewimble an output created and spent inside the same block can be
//! deleted along with the input that spends it, erasing the intermediate step
//! entirely. That works because ownership there is proven solely by knowing a
//! blinding factor, which the kernel already covers.
//!
//! Nightfall additionally signs each input with the one-time key `Ko` of the
//! output being spent. That signature is what makes *non-interactive* payments
//! safe — without it the sender, who knows the output's blinding factor, could
//! sweep back what they sent. Deleting the input would delete that
//! authorisation, so cut-through and one-sided payments are mutually
//! exclusive. The `docs/DECISIONS.md` lock chose one-sided payments, because a
//! wallet where both parties must be online at once is not a wallet most
//! people can use.
//!
//! The consequence, stated plainly: **spent outputs remain visible on chain,
//! so the transaction graph is obscured but not erased.** `docs/ATTRIBUTES.md`
//! claims a full-set anonymity class; aggregation narrows that gap without
//! closing it. Closing it needs a proof system that can authorise a spend
//! without publishing a per-input signature.
